The five example strings in this folder were created by copying snippets from the following two (English) Wikipedia pages:

"Helsinki": http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helsinki&oldid=642043476
"Black-capped_kingfisher": http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black-capped_kingfisheroldid=642457216

The strings were constructed as follows:

string1.txt: The first five paragraphs of "Helsinki"

string2.txt: Same as string1.txt, but the the third paragraph is replaced with "This is a new sentence about a different topic, which does not occur in string1."

string3.txt: Same as string2.txt, but the third paragraph has been replaced with three other paragraphs from "Helsinki"

string4.txt: Same as string4.txt, but the substring "(both 100 km (62 mi) from Helsinki" in the fourth paragraph is replaced with "(both 100 km (62 mi) from Hilsinki"

string5.txt: The first paragraph from "Black-capped_kingfisher"

Consequences for compression with CDAG aare as follows:

1) string1.txt and string5.txt are chosen as a main references

2) string2.txt is compressed against string1.txt (and with few spurious snippets against string5.txt)

3) string3.txt is compressed against string1.txt and string2.txt (and with few spurious snippets against string5.txt)

4) string4.txt is compressed against string3.txt (and with few spurious snippets against string1.txt)

Note that for this small toy example MRCSI instances are larger than the naive indexes (CST /ESA), since MRCSI only pays off for indexing many larger documents. This toy example is only intended to show how to execute MRCSI in general.
